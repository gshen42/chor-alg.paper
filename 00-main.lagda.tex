\title{Toward Verified Library-Level Choreographic Programming with Algebraic Effects}

\begin{abstract}
  Choreographic programming (CP) is a paradigm for programming distributed applications that run on multiple nodes.
  %
  In CP, instead of implementing individual programs for each node, the programmer writes one, unified program, called a \emph{choreography}, that is then compiled to individual programs for each node via a step called \emph{endpoint projection} (EPP).
  %
  A correct CP language guarantees soundness and completeness of EPP, which further implies that the resulting programs are deadlock-free when running together.
  %
  Prior work have explored using formal reasoning systema to build verified CP languages.
  %
  However, they fall short of being widely applicable because they are standalone languages that don't integrate with existing language infrastures.

  We propose implementing a CP language \emph{as a library} using algebraic effects and proving its correctness, both in proof assistant Agda.
  %
  We use algebraic effects to give a mixed-embedding of CP with CP-specific effects and control flows deeply embedded --- enabling reasoning about them --- pure computations and variable bindings shallowly embedded --- enabling seamless integration with the host language.
  %
  We believe the resulting implementation can be easily either extracted from Agda or ported to a different language that supports algebraic effects without many changes, thus bringing CP to a broader audience with greater confidence in its correctness.

  In this paper, we outline our plan for building a verified CP language with algebraic effects.
  %
  In particular, we show how to define choreographies as computations with uninterpreted effects and EPP as giving location-varying (\gs{is this a word?}) interpretations to those effects.
  %
  We state the correctness condition for EPP in the end.
