\title{Toward Verified Library-Level Choreographic Programming with Algebraic Effects}

\begin{abstract}
  Choreographic programming (CP) is a paradigm for programming distributed applications that run on multiple nodes.
  %
  In CP, instead of implementing individual programs for each node, the programmer writes one, unified program, called a \emph{choreography}, that is then compiled to individual programs for each node via a step called \emph{endpoint projection} (EPP).
  %
  A correct CP language ensures soundness and completeness of EPP, which further implies that the resulting programs are deadlock-free when running together.
  %
  Prior work have explored using formal reasoning systems to build verified CP languages.
  %
  However, they fall short of being widely applicable because they are standalone languages that don't integrate with existing language infrastures.

  We propose using algebraic effects to implement a verified \emph{library-level} CP language.
  %
  Our use of algebraic effects is two-fold:
  %
  First, as an implementation abstraction, they allow us to define choreographies as computations with user-defined effects and EPP as providing location-varying~(\gs{is this a word?}) interpretations for those effects, all within the host language.
  %
  Second, as a proof technique, they provide abstract syntax trees for choreographies where CP-specific effects and control flows are manifest, enabling reasoning about them.
  %
  We carry out our verified implementation in the proof assistant Agda.
  %
  We believe the resulting implementation can be easily either extracted from Agda or ported to a different language that natively supports or can simulate algebraic effects, thus bringing CP to a broader audience with greater confidence in its correctness.

  In this paper, we outline our plan for building a verified library-level CP language with algebraic effects.
  %
  In particular, we show how to define choreographies and EPP with algebraic effects in Agda.
  %
  In the end, we state the correctness condition for EPP.
