\section{Next Steps}

In this section, we outline some potential next steps.

\subsection{Finish the Proofs and Consider Common Extensions}

We need to finish the correctness proofs and consider common extensions like conditionals and recursions (which might require a coinductive variant of \textit{Term}).

\subsection{Liberate EPP and Relax the Correctness Condition}

Being at the library-level means that user can write their own version of EPP easily.
%
These EPPs might do various kinds of optimization or adapt to a customized communication pattern, which do not necessarily preserve or reflect the semantics of the original choreography.
%
The standard correctness condition asks for a strong bisimulation, meaning the two systems have the same \emph{behavior}.
%
Maybe the two systems compute the same value, or simply the resulting network being deadlock-free is enough

\subsection{More Implementations}

Bring the idea to more languages, especially languages with native support of algebraic effects.
