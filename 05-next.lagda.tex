\section{Next Steps}
\label{sec:next}

Our next step will be to leverage the algebraic-effects-based formulation of CP presented in the last two sections to prove the correctness of endpoint projection, as well as follow-on properties such as deadlock freedom.

\lk{TODO: fix typesetting here}

At a high level, given a choreographic semantics \AgdaFunction{⇒ᶜ} and a network semantics \AgdaFunction{⇒ⁿ}, \emph{completeness} of endpoint projection would say that the network \emph{preserves} the semantics of the original choreography. That is, given choreographies \AgdaArgument{c} and \AgdaArgument{c′}, \AgdaRef{epp c ⇒ⁿ epp c′ → c ⇒ᶜ c′}.
%
\emph{Soundness} of EPP, on the other hand, would say that the network \emph{reflects} the semantics of the original choreography, that is, given choreographies \AgdaArgument{c} and \AgdaArgument{c′}, \AgdaRef{c ⇒ᶜ c′ → epp c ⇒ⁿ epp c′}.
%
However, these correctness conditions are very strong, and may be too strong for our setting.
%
For example, we want our choreographic language to support conditionals and recursion (which might require a coinductive variant of \textit{Term}).
%
Therefore, are working on defining an appropriate choreographic semantics \AgdaFunction{⇒ᶜ} and network semantics \AgdaFunction{⇒ⁿ}, and establishing notions of soundness and completeness that are appropriate for our setting.

In the longer term, we want to bring our algebraic-effects-based formulation of CP to languages with efficient native support for algebraic effects, such as OCaml. 

%% \subsection{Liberate EPP and Relax the Correctness Condition}

%% Being at the library-level means that user can write their own version of EPP easily.
%% %
%% These EPPs might do various kinds of optimization or adapt to a customized communication pattern, which do not necessarily preserve or reflect the semantics of the original choreography.
%% %
%% The standard correctness condition asks for a strong bisimulation, meaning the two systems have the same \emph{behavior}.
%% %
%% Maybe the two systems compute the same value, or simply the resulting network being deadlock-free is enough
